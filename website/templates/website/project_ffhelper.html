{% block project_description %}
Fantasy Football Helper helps you pick your NFL fantasy football team by providing recommended players based on their
past performances, what positions you currently need to fill or whether you already have a full compliment of starters.
The script recommends those players who are still available with the best historic performance and also those who have the best value
in comparison to the mean of players in their position.
